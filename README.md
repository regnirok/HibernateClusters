# HibernateClusters
Powershell scripts designed to help automate both Hiberate and Resume operations for Nutanix Clusters on cloud platforms.

Currently you'll need to provide your ClusterID for the cluster itself, and your Client ID and Client Secret from your API Credential API Key within MCM.  Future versions will accept user provided variables from Calm and potentially fit for receiving Client ID and Secret as credentials from Nutanix Calm.
